# Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization

## Part 1

One Elf has the important job of loading all of hte [rucksacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpack) with supplies
for the jungle journey. Unfortunately, that Elf didn't quite follow the 
packing instructions, and so a few items now need to be rearranged.

Each rucksack has two large __compartments__. All items of a given type are
meant to go into exactly one of the two compartments. The Elf that did the
packing failed to follow this rule for exactly one item type per rucksack.
